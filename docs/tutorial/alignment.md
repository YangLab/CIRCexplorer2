# Alignment for Circular RNA Fusion Junction Reads

CIRCexplorer2 supports TopHat2/TopHat-Fusion and other aligners (STAR, segemehl, BWA and MapSplice). Although different aligners showed slight difference in circular RNA identification, TopHat2/TopHat-Fusion has a perfect match with Cufflinks. As a result, TopHat2/TopHat-Fusion is recommended in alignment step, especially for [circular RNA characterization pipeline](../tutorial/pipeline.md).


## TopHat2/TopHat-Fusion

Because TopHat2 needs gene annotation file for better alignment, you could select one GTF file from `hg19_ref.gtf`, `hg19_kg.gtf` and `hg19_ens.gtf`. In addition, TopHat2 needs genome index files for bowtie2, and TopHat-Fusion require indices for bowtie1, so you could index the genome sequence in advance or let `CIRCexplorer2 align` to do it from scratch. (See [Setup](../tutorial/setup.md))

* From index files (`bowtie1_index` is the prefix for bowtie1 index files, and `bowtie2_index` is the prefix for bowtie2 index files):
```
CIRCexplorer2 align -G hg19_kg.gtf -i bowtie1_index -j bowtie2_index -f RNA_seq.fastq > CIRCexplorer2_align.log
```

* Or from genome sequence:
```
CIRCexplorer2 align -G hg19_kg.gtf -g hg19.fa -f RNA_seq.fastq > CIRCexplorer2_align.log
```

### Note

1. Because Cufflinks is well compatible with TopHat2/TopHat-Fusion, it is recommended to use TopHat2/TopHat-Fusion alignment for [characterization pipeline](../tutorial/pipeline.md).
2. `CIRCexplorer2 align` will create a directory `alignment`, and the BED file `fusion_junction.bed` that is required for following analysis. You could also check `tophat.log` and `tophat_fusion.log` file for detailed logs of Tophat2 and TopHat-Fusion alignment.
3. See [Align](../modules/align.md) for detailed information about `CIRCexplorer2 align`.

## To align manually

If you prefer other aligners or want to align paired-end reads, you could align sequencing reads manually. Commands for different aligners for detecting fusion junction reads are listed below, and you could modify them according to your different requirements.

### For single-read sequencing

* TopHat2/TopHat-Fusion
```
tophat2 -a 6 --microexon-search -m 2 -p 10 -G knownGene.gtf -o tophat hg19_bowtie2_index RNA_seq.fastq
bamToFastq -i tophat/unmapped.bam -fq tophat/unmapped.fastq
tophat2 -o tophat_fusion -p 15 --fusion-search --keep-fasta-order --bowtie1 --no-coverage-search hg19_bowtie1_index tophat/unmapped.fastq
```

* STAR (See [STAR manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf) for more information)
```
STAR --chimSegmentMin 10 --runThreadN 10 --genomeDir hg19_STAR_index --readFilesIn RNA_seq.fastq
```

* MapSplice (See [MapSplice](http://www.netlab.uky.edu/p/bioinfo/MapSplice2UserGuide) for more information)
```
mapsplice.py -p 10 -k 1 --non-canonical --fusion-non-canonical --min-fusion-distance 200 -c hg19_dir -x bowtie1_index --gene-gtf hg19_kg.gtf -1 RNA_seq.fastq
```

* BWA (See [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) for more information)
```
bwa mem -T 19 -t 10 hg19_bwa_index RNA_seq.fastq > RNA_seq_bwa.sam
```

* segemehl (See [segemehl manual](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/segemehl_manual_0_1_7.pdf) for more information)
```
segemehl.x -q RNA_seq.fastq -d hg19.fa -i hg19_segemehl.idx -S -M 1 -t 10 -o RNA_seq.sam
testrealign.x -d hg19.fa -q RNA_seq.sam -n
```

Note: You could align unmapped reads from TopHat2 alignment (`circ_out/tophat/unmapped.fastq`) via other aligners rather than TopHat-Fusion.

### For paired-end sequencing

* STAR (See [STAR manual](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf) for more information)

```
STAR --chimSegmentMin 10 --runThreadN 10 --genomeDir hg19_STAR_index --readFilesIn read_1.fastq read_2.fastq
```

* TopHat-Fusion

```
tophat2 -o tophat_fusion -p 15 --fusion-search --keep-fasta-order --bowtie1 --no-coverage-search hg19_bowtie1_index read_1.fastq read_2.fastq
```

Note:

1. For alignment of paired-end data, you should choose appropriate library-type which is not included in the command above.
